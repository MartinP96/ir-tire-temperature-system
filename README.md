# ir-tire-temperature-system
A project for measuring motorcycle tire temperature with IR temperature sensors. The project is still work in progress. 
Project is based on Arduino embeded platform. For measuring the temperature we are using two MLX90614 IR temperature sensors. For user interface we are using a 
small TFT LCD screen. All code is written in C++. F

For interfacing TFT screen we are using MCUFRIEND_kbv library: https://github.com/prenticedavid/MCUFRIEND_kbv

Two sample images of TFT user interaface:
